**Project Description**

A movie recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The TMDB5000 Movies dataset, a popular dataset containing information about thousands of movies, including details such as movie titles, genres, ratings, and popularity, is used in this project to build a movie recommendation system.

The goal of this project is to analyze the TMDB5000 Movies dataset and develop a movie recommendation system that identifies patterns, relationships, and trends in the data to make personalized movie recommendations to users. The system may employ techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to generate recommendations.

Leveraging the rich source of data provided by the TMDB5000 Movies dataset, the recommendation system aims to provide users with personalized movie suggestions that are tailored to their interests and viewing habits. The project may involve data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to build an effective recommendation system that delivers accurate and relevant movie recommendations to users. In this repository, you can check out the different branches that cover various approaches commonly used by people or companies in developing their recommendation systems.
